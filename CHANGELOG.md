## CHANGELOG

* UPDATED:
  * WordPress Core:
    * from v5.9.x to v6.3.2
  * Dependencies:

* UPDATED:

* BREAKING:
    * Removed the platform block, eliminating the enforced PHP 7.4 version constraint from the composer.
    * Removed all optional themes and plugins. We now default to a single theme (twentytwentythree) and one default plugin (Akismet). You're free to include any additional plugins or themes as needed. The aim is to make this bundle as generic and non-opinionated as possible.

### v1.2.1 (May 24, 2020)

* ADD:
    - Add more useful plugins
        - Optimisation
            - fast-velocity-minify: I've been trying out several plugins, this one is effective
            - imagekit - for image optimisation & serving images through CDN. Very effective & you get 20GB per month which is great for normal bloggers.

    - update WordPress core to v5.4.1
    - update all dependencies to their respective latest versions
    
* DELETE:
    - remove plugins:
        - sucuri-scanner: 
            - while using it on 3 prod servers, I notice too many constant bot from this plugin. It keeps hitting the server constantly, apparently for scanning. But this can be a resource hog. I'll do without it.
            - besides, I do not see anything amazing which is not covered by the current ninjafirewall in our list
            - too commercial VS genuine benefit

### v1.2.0

* ADD:
    - Add some useful plugins
        - SEO-wise:
            - google-sitemap-generator (simple best at it down the yrs and from our experience)

            - pretty-link (for all redirects & static files..etc)
        - Security-wise (the combo below are best free & effective & complements each other)
            - sucuri-scanner
            - ninjafirewall
        - CRON managers (since we turn off, these are good monitors)
            - wp-cron-status-checker
            - wp-crontrol
        - BACKUP
            - updraftplus (simply the best out there)
        - optimisation plugin | (database + image + caching + compression)
            - wp-optimize (see: https://getwpo.com/)
